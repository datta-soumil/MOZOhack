  ### MOZOHACK

### Hi there, Welcome to our Project created by team Daily Debuggers ðŸ‘‹
<br>

## A sneak-peak of our project -->
The main problem that students or anyone in general who are starting out with programming/learning coding languages, is that they do not know where to start, with abundance of resources available online and books, it can be overwhelming for people as to where they should learn and which is the right place for it. Many a times, an online platform for learning might only have video tutorials, or only for practicing, so there is not much variety.


## What makes our project unique from others?

Well,There are a lot of things which are soo unique in our project and they cannot be found anywhere. Wondering how ? ðŸ¤” 
Here are few points which  makes our project so much unique -->

- ðŸŒ± This website is best for absolute begginers who are struggling to find good resources to get started with their coding journey.
- ðŸ”­ On our website you can simultaneously learn by reading, watching and coding!
   - ðŸ‘¯ Reading :- On our website one can find pdfs of all the **top rated books**.
   - ðŸ¥… Watching :- On our website you can explore languages by **video lectures** which are made by professionals.
